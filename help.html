            <h4>What is Join?</h4>
            <p><span class="highlighted">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
                part of
                their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
            <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="highlighted">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help
                users
                manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that <span class="highlighted">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for
                extensive
                business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee
                consistent

            <section class="how-to-use">
                <div class="how-to-use-li">
                    <div class="how-to-use-numbers">1.</div>
                    <div class="textbox-how-to-use-li">
                    <h5>Exploring the Board</h5>
                    <p>When you log in to <span class="highlighted">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and
                        contains
                        four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="how-to-use-numbers">2.</div>
                    <div class="textbox-how-to-use-li">
                    <h5>Creating Contacts</h5>
                    <p>In <span class="highlighted">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                        click on
                        "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
                        tasks
                        and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
                    </div></div>
                <div class="how-to-use-li">
                    <div class="how-to-use-numbers">3.</div>
                    <div class="textbox-how-to-use-li">
                    <h5>Adding Cards</h5>
                    <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                        tasks. Click
                        the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the
                        card,
                        like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
                    </div></div>
                <div class="how-to-use-li">

                    <div class="textbox-how-to-use-li">
                    <h5>Moving Cards</h5>
                    <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                        dropping
                        the card from one list to another.</p>
                </div></div>
                <div class="how-to-use-li">
                    <div class="how-to-use-numbers">5.</div>
                    <div class="textbox-how-to-use-li">
                    <h5>Deleting Cards</h5>
                    <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card
                        will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                        action is irreversible.</p>
                    <p>Remember thats using <span class="highlighted">Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to
                        ensure
                        the board reflects the current state of your project.</p>
